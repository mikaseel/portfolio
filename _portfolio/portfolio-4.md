Project description: Built a comprehensive data pipeline that integrated data from three different sources—Spotify API and 2 from Kaggle datasets—using Python and SQL to process and upload the collected data into a PostgreSQL database. The entire pipeline was containerized using Docker to ensure portability, scalability, and ease of deployment. A web API was developed to automate workflows using Apache Airflow to enable efficient data retrieval, manipulation, updates, and pipeline management.
