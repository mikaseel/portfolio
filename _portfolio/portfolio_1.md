Project description: Convolutional Neutral Network (CNN) was created using PyTorch to classify five different varieties of rice. The project focused on achieving high accuracy and providing interpretability for the model's predictions by using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to visualize and explain the modelâ€™s decision-making process.
