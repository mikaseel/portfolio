Project description: Explored the Auto-MPG dataset to model and predict fuel efficiency (mpg) of various automobiles using two key approaches: a Gaussian distributional model and a linear regression model. The analysis follows a structured workflow, including ETL, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data transformations to enhance model performance and interpretability. The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing fuel efficiency and highlights the strengths and limitations of different modeling techniques.
