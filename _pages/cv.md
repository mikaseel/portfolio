Education
======
* **Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering**
  * Master of Science, Data Science | GPA: 3.75 | August 2022—August 2024
  *	**Data Science: Modeling and Analytics**
    *	Developed expertise in the design and implementation of sophisticated data models integrating principles from AI, machine learning, and statistics. Proficient in identifying patterns and relationships within diverse data sets, employing intelligent algorithms, machine learning techniques, and statistical methods to create expressive models that reveal intrinsic patterns and insights.
    *	Skilled in the comprehensive modeling process, from framework design to model evaluation and interpretation. Demonstrated ability to select appropriate model types, apply Python-based frameworks effectively, and represent outputs in an understandable and explainable manner.
  *	**Bayesian Statistics**
    *	Applied Bayesian inference techniques to estimate population parameters, evaluate estimation uncertainty, and solve decision theory problems by using the application of prior/posterior distributions, conjugate pairs, Bayesian prediction, and Monte Carlo and Gibbs sampling methods for real-world data analysis.
  *	**Data Engineering Principles and Practice**
    *	Utilized relational and NoSQL databases for data collection, transformation, and modeling for various data formats.
    *	Utilized pipelines and workflow automation to move data into warehouses and data lakes with the conscious of data security, governance, and compliance.
  *	**Theory of Machine Learning**
    *	Explored machine learning algorithms and mathematical theories of linear models (regression and classification), anomaly detectors, tree-based methods, regularization, fully connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks using TensorFlow and PyTorch, and model assessment using Python
  *	**Data Visualization**
    *	Used Tableau, Microsoft PowerBI, Paraview, Python, and Jupyter Lab to create interactive visualizations for large datasets
